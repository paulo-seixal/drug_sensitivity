## exploration and pre-processing ##

- describe the problem
- describe dataset (how many drugs, 
                    how many cell lines,
                    how many genes in each cell line,
                    how many combinations,
                    mean ic50,
                    etc)

- gene expression data is RMD normalized. explain what is rmd (relative mean difference)

- check nan values (there are some gene names with 'nan' values)
- check duplicates
- build a grid image with the chemical structures of the drugs (not all, maybe the first 50 or something...)(same thing as last year - rdkit package)
- plot with drug frequency, and another with cell line frequency
- plot with mean ic50 for each drug (maybe we should denormalize the ic50, for better interpretability)
- plot with mean ic50 for each cell line tissue group (https://cog.sanger.ac.uk/cancerrxgene/GDSC_release8.5/Cell_Lines_Details.xlsx) (maybe we should denormalize the ic50, for better interpretability)
- maybe analyze the drug's descriptors (like last year with rdkit package)


## non-supervised ##
- 2 dimensions pca
- 3 dimensions pca
- hierarchical clustering
- k-means clustering (use elbow method)

## baseline machine learning ##
- general idea: 
    3 ml models (svm, LinearRegression, GradientBoostingRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor)



# deep learning ##
- build something similar to paccmann package (https://github.com/PaccMann/paccmann_predictor_tf)
